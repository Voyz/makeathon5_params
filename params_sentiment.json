It is your fault, you didn't remind me! If the team finds out, they will be very disappointed! When can you send me the necessary files? Please set up a meeting so that we can discuss how to proceed.\"\nSentiment: unsatisfied\n \nMessage: \"Hey Anna and Nathan! Great work! I reviewed the marketing slides and will send you some positive feedback as soon as possible. I'm very impressed by your ability to work on that task. Keep up the great work. I'm really looking forward to meet you next week.\"\nSentiment: enthusiastic\n  \nMessage: \"Hello dear Mr Steven. I would suggest that we organize the meeting at 9:00 PM. Yana and Yanis said that they will join the meeting later, and we will talk about our analysis of lead in certain foods with the Atom absorption spectrometry. And as you know, it's a very precise instrument for this specific analysis, so we will talk a little bit about that. I just need a quick answer to let me know if you have time. And I'm looking forward to our meeting.\"\nSentiment: neutral\n \nMessage: \"Well guys, since we have our presentation on globalization next week, I just wanted to ask whether you are available. I would say maybe I don't know Wednesday at 3:00 PM we could meet via Zoom. Or yeah, what's most suitable for you? I think we already we still have to discuss how to structure the presentation, and I'm not sure whether we should talk about the changing dynamics with China, for example, as well.\"\nSentiment: neutral\n\nMessage: \"Why the hell have you already wasted all your GPT3 Tokens? Are you serious? You have to pay for all of them asap! If you continue on to disrespect my orders I have to consider electing somebody else for this position. You fucked up!\"\nSentiment: unsatisfied\n\nMessage: \"I was very impressed  with your overall performance yesterday. I think you should do presentations regarding our new product way more often than Peter. This may lead to increased sales in the next quarter. I'm looking forward to it!\"\nSentiment: enthusiastic\n\nMessage:\"Pretty hard to get excited about this, but I am impressed. Not only do you get three of them for a modest amount but they are well packaged, well made and well designed. What particularly caught my admiration was that someone had really thought about the practicality of the design. Great product!\"\nSentiment: enthusiastic\n\nMessage: \"This course was aweful! The overall course lacks structure and substance. The quizes were just terrible. Please dont waste your time with this.\"\nSentiment: unsatisfied\n\nMessage: \"Ok so I have a few ideas how we can organize and split our tasks to be more efficient. You know because we have limited time to come up with a product. So I think we can split our jobs best suited for us right now. Our web master Voy can start working on the webapp. The rest of us are still working on the prompt. Maybe we can up with more samples for testing and structuring. What do you guys think?\"\nSentiment: neutral",
